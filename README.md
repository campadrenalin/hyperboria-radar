Adding your repo
----------------
To add your repo, first go to your repo on github, click settings->service hooks.
Select *WebHook URLs*, and add the following URL:

`http://www.thefinn93.com:8080/github/`

Then hit save. Next bug me. Easiest way is proly to submit a pull request to this
file up top where the repos are listed. I'll accept pretty much anything related
to hyperboria, so if you're unsure just ask anyway.

I'm working on Gitboria support. If you don't use either gitlab or gitboria say so in
the pull request and I'll set it up.
