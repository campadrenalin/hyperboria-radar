`#radar` is a channel on HypeIRC for monitoring the goings ons of things on and
related to Hyperboria. It follows some RSS feeds, some git repos, every post on
[uppit](http://uppit.us), etc. If you want something posted, let me know.
`finn@meshwith.me` is a good way to get in contact with me, as is [my twitter](https://twitter.com/thefinn93),
[my reddit](http://www.reddit.com/u/thefinn93) and my [uppit](http://uppit.us/u/thefinn93).
